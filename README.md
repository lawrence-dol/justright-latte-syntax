# Professional Syntax Theme for Atom

A minimal, professional theme designed to draw attention to the actual code while pushing the comments & "punctuation" into the background. This theme takes the approach of only accentuating things that really matter. I find the typical "explosion" of colors to be distracting and unhelpful.

I take the approach of distinguishing the significant, high-level elements of a program. The reasoning applied is that reading and comprehension of the code is paramount, and this means colors should be used sparingly, and that the palette should consist of complimentary colors. You will not see hot-pink in this theme. Examples of elements which are differentiated are:

  - **`Code   :`** comments, operators, brackets, text, compiler/preprocess directives, literal values.
  - **`CSS    :`** element selectors, relational-operators, class selectors, pseudo-elements, keywords, literal values.
  - **`Markup :`** elements, attributes, identity attributes (name, id, and class), values, brackets, text.

 Text elements (in code, that would be things like keywords, identifiers, etc), minor differentiation is done with intensity, such that the main body is one color chosen for good contrast and readability, and other things are made slightly darker or lighter as appropriate.
